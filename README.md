## ⚡ Why This Exists

Job hunting shouldn't feel like a full-time job — especially when:
- Listings are vague or spammy
- You have to rewrite the same cover letter 10 times
- You're tracking everything across tabs, notes, and screenshots

**Nononsense Agent** was built to solve the exact burnout I faced while job searching.  
If it's helping me, it might help you too.
